## Explanation

- In this problem it was asked to add `two binary` numbers and give their `sum` as `binary`.
- I converted the give two binary numbers to `integers of base 2`.
- I then added these `two numbers` as integers and got the result which i converted back to binary using `bin function`.
- I then displayed this binary number after removing the `0b` in the beginning.
