## Explanation

- Here we have to `merge` and `sort` two `linked list`.
- First we create a `empty list`.
- The address of the empty list is assigned to a variable to called `tail`.
- A while loop is implemented.
- The loop goes through each element of the list.
- After comparing the data in each list, it is added to the `tail`.
- Whatever element is left is added to the end of the list using a `if` condition for both lists.
